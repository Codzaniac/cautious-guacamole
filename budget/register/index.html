<p1> In general we dont really keep a watch on our daily expences and sometimes we dont realise that we have actually been spending money on most of the things unnecessarily.
  
</br>The idea is that if you dont know where your money is and what you are doing with it,then it is really hard to expect much of your money.
<br/>
</br>Tracking of your money can help you gain awareness of where your money goes. then with a bit of budgeting you can set targets and build towards your savings and investments.</p1>
</br></br>
<p2> budget generation and transaction tracker helps you to keep a look on your daily expenses  and manage your budget accordingly.
</br>With this you can record your daily expenditure for future reference. 

</br>
</br>One will first have to create an account after which he is ready to go. One can enter his daily expenditure either on daily basis or weekly basis depending on his leasure time.

</br>This is easy to access  and is very youseful specially when you have to keep an eye on your expences.</p2>
